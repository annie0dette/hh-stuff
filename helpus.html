<h1>Get Involved</h1>
First Grace United Methodist Church members, students through our service learning partnerships, and members of the wider community all provide vital services and support to Hagar's House. 
<br><br>
Frequent volunteer needs are for child care, children's programs, bicycle maintenance & repair, house maintenance and repair, tutoring or homework help for both adults and children, yard work & gardening, cleaning, fundraising (organizing a fundraiser of your own or staffing/helping with a fundraiser organized by the house of one of our partners), and organizing a drive for currently needed items (please contact our donations coordinator to learn what those needs are). We also welcome volunteers who offer one-time or recurring programs & services for individuals or groups of adult residents.
<br><br>
Should you be interested in working with us please send an email to Carolyn Mayes at hagarshousevolunteers@gmail.com with a brief message explaining
<br>
<ul>
	<li>your interest in Hagar's House</li>
	<li>how you would like to be involved</li>
	<li>how to get in contact with you</li>
</ul>
and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.
<br><br>
Because Hagar's House is a home first and foremost, we are not usually able to accommodate large groups of volunteers.
