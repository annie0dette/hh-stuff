<h2>Sustainable Transitions</h2>
During a stay at Hagar's House, residents and staff work together in Capacity Building partnerships. At weekly, one-on-one meetings with a staff partner, residents set their goals and determine the steps they need to take to reach these goals. Hagar's House supports residents in all parts of their lives as they move towards transitioning out of Hagar's House and into sustainable permanent housing.
